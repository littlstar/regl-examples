Example usage of regl

## Building

If you have the `make` command exposed on your system then simply run:

```sh
$ make
```

This will install all dependencies with `yarn` or `npm` and build all
examples located in the `src/` directory into the `www/` directory.

If you prefer to build without `make` then install the dependencies with
`yarn` or `npm` manually and invoke

```sh
$ ./bin/build
```

## Running an example

If you have the `make` command exposed on your system then simply run:

```sh
$ make basic.js
```

You can replaxce `basic.js` with whichever example you would like to run
found in the `src/` directory.
