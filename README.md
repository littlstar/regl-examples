Example usage of regl

## Building

Before building be sure to run:

```sh
$ npm install
```

then run:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

## Running an example

If you have the `make` command exposed on your system then simply run:

```sh
$ make basic.js
```

You can replace `basic.js` with whichever example you would like to run
found in the `src/` directory.

You can also run `budo` directly to run the examples:


```sh
$ budo src/basic.js --open
```
